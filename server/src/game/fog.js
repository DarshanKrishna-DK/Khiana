 * generous sideways (you see into the mouths of side passages) and far too
 * mean forwards (a long straight corridor goes black three tiles out, even
 * though in reality you could see all the way down it).

 * The flanking walls of a lit corridor tile are added too. Without them the
 * floor of the passage lights up between two black voids, which reads as a
 * bridge over a chasm rather than a hallway.
